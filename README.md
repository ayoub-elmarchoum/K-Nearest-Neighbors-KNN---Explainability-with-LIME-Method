# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN---Explainability-with-LIME-Method
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, enhanced with the LIME method for interpretability. While KNN is simple, it lacks transparency. LIME provides local, interpretable explanations for individual predictions, helping to clarify how features influence KNN's decisions.
